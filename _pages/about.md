<b>About Me</b>

Hello and welcome! 👋  

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Biostatistics Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH). I have the great privilege of working with Senior Principal Investigators [Paul S. Albert](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/albert-paul) and [Jianxin Shi](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/shi-jianxin), whose mentorship continues to shape how I think about statistics, science, and meaningful research questions.

I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematical Statistics in 2025 from the University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP). I was very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Doron Levy](https://math.umd.edu/~dlevy/) and co-mentored by [Paul S. Albert](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/albert-paul), [Jianxin Shi](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/shi-jianxin), and [Hyokyoung G. Hong](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/hong-grace) through the NIH Graduate Partnerships Program (GPP).  

Before UMCP, I received my Master’s degree in Mathematics (2016) from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), mentored by Profs. [Xinan Ma](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~xinan/) and [Hui Liu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hui-Liu-244). I completed my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics (2014) at Nanjing Normal University (NNU), under the guidance of Prof. [Yujun Dong](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Dong-Yujun-2010657826).

In short: I have been happily doing math for quite a while now — and somehow it keeps getting more interesting. 😊

<b>Research Interests</b>

My research sits at the intersection of statistics and public health. I am broadly interested in developing state-of-the-art statistical methods while asking scientifically meaningful questions about the etiology of human diseases.

More specifically, I work on:

* **Statistical modeling for correlated biomedical outcomes**, including longitudinal data analysis, diagnostic testing, and biomarker studies (where the data are often messy, dependent, and fascinating).
* **Statistical and computational methods for EHR, real-world data (RWD), and large-scale studies**, with a particular focus on genetic data analysis for personalized and early detection of prostate cancer.
* **Applications of statistical methods — including machine learning and deep learning — to cancer genetic epidemiology, nutritional research, and metabolomics.**

I am especially motivated by problems where rigorous methodology meets real-world clinical impact.

<b>Hobbies</b>

Beyond research, I enjoy spending time outdoors — hiking, kayaking, skiing, swimming, and playing badminton. If it involves fresh air or movement, I’m usually in.

I also love exploring new places and restaurants (statistical sampling, but for food). I’m an avid reader, particularly books on art, aesthetics, and Eastern philosophy, and I maintain a regular meditation practice to stay grounded — which turns out to be quite helpful when models refuse to converge.
