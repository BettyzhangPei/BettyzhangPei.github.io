I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Biostatistics Branch, Division of Cancer in Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), working with Senior Principle Investigators [Paul S. Albert](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/albert-paul) and [Jianxin Shi](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/shi-jianxin). I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematical Statistics from University of Maryland, College Park (UMCP) and was honored to be advised by Prof. [Doron Levy](https://math.umd.edu/~dlevy/), Senior Principle Investigators [Paul S. Albert](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/albert-paul), [Jianxin Shi](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/shi-jianxin) and [Hyokyoung G. Hong](https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/hong-grace) under the NIH Graduate Partnerships Program (GPP). Prior to UMCP, I obtained my Master’s degree in Mathematics in 2016 from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and was honored to be mentored by Prof. [Xinan Ma](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~xinan/), and my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics in 2014 from Nanjing Normal University (NNU).

Research Interests
===========
My research lies at the intersection of statistics and public health, with the goal of developing state-of-the-art statistical methods and understanding the etiology of human diseases. Specifically, my research focuses on:
* statistical modeling for correlated biomedical outcomes, including the analysis of longitudinal data, diagnostic testing and date from biomarker studies;
* statistical and computational methodologies for electronic health records (EHR), real-world data (RWD) and large-scale studies, with a focus on genetic data analysis for personalized, early detection of prostate cancer;
* application of statistical methods, including machine learning and deep learning, to cancer genetic epidemiology, nutritional research, and metabolomics etc.

Hobbies
==========
Beyond research, I enjoy hiking, kayaking, and exploring new places and restaurants. I’m an avid reader, especially of books on art, aesthetics, and eastern philosophy, and I maintain a regular meditation practice to stay grounded.
